# port-scanner

hello yall whats good ?

this is a python port scanner that i've devoloped with my colleages 

it takes an input from a user as an ip and gave what ports are open 

what shall we do first ?

1-we should Enhance the code first 
for devolopers : save the template to your local machine

2-we create a wep page for the code that also take input from the user but as a GUI (if possible)

3-host the python scanner on a linux server (apache or nginx)
